## Project Overview

The challenge consists of three tasks:

1. **UI Challenge: Interactive Photo Gallery**: Implement an interactive and responsive photo gallery based on the provided Figma designs.
## coding-challenges

## array-manipulation
2. **Coding Challenge 1: Array Manipulation**: Determine if a contiguous subarray within an array sums up to a target value.In this challenge i have used the sliding window (or two-pointer) technique is used to efficiently find the subarray with the given target sum. This approach ensures an optimal time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1).
   
## string-transformation
3. **Coding Challenge 2: String Transformation**: Transform a given string based on specific rules related to its length.


## usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AganzeFelicite/COA-Challenge
   ```
2. Move into the repository
    ``` bash
    cd COA-Challenge
    ```
3. Run the index.html found in the html folder => this is to view the Gallery

4. to run the challenges since there is already test cases
   move into the folder named challenges run the following commands, after installing node js
   ``` bash
   node arrayMap.js 
   ```
   and 
   ``` bash 
   node stringTransform.js
   ```
   for each coding challenges
